# ProductSquare

Every 7 weeks, professionally trained student engineers are creating new products. Every 7 weeks, non-profit organizations in need of software engineers have the opportunity to get their product idea built out for free. ProductSquare is the townsquare for individuals/non-profits to submit product ideas and for student engineers to turn these ideas into a reality. It also provides a platform for student engineers to showcase their portfolio, view what other engineers are developing, and get product ideas from the community. At essence, ProductSquare helps developers brand themselves with projects that matter.
